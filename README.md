## How to Embed Video into PowerPoint ?

Open up your project and navigate to the place/slide where you wish to insert your video. On the menu at the top left, check the “Insert” tab. Then, move across over to the right and click the video button, and select “Online video.”

Up pops a screen that asks you to insert your video. There is a function that says, “From a Video Embed Code.” This is where you paste the video embed code you got from YouTube earlier.

Once you have inserted the video, click the arrow on the right to load the video into your PowerPoint presentation.

The video will appear in your PowerPoint as a simple box. You may move and resize the box. Obviously, when you play your PowerPoint presentation, the box is replaced by your video. In most cases, you can preview your video right away by double-clicking the video box. When you test out your PowerPoint slide, all you have to do is click the play icon and the video will play. The video will also contain YouTube tools, such as a sound slider, unless you disabled the tools during the embed process.
